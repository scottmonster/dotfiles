learn some lua and learn some ansible

- use win.bat to introduce bash into the environment
  - actually since i don't really care about windows at the moment im going to skip this and just use cmd to install choco and choco to install lua

- notwin.sh should get us to the point where we have lua installed on overything else
- after the above is done we can run or lua script for everything else



run with
``` bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottmonster/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/bin/run.sh | sudo bash

```
